                <h3>Gado gado with summer vegetables</h3>
                <p>A chilli-spiked, lime-seasoned peanut sauce mellowed with coconut cream to season summer vegetables.
                    Adjust the chilli heat to levels that make you happy.</p>

                <p>We love the combination of pea hummus and sun-dried tomatoes, but you can spread the tortillas with
                    anything you want, including dulce de leche, bananas and toasted hazelnuts.</p>
